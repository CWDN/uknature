Amphibians,Common Frog,Rana temporaria,"Up to 10cm long, the Common Frog has an upperside whose ground colour ranges from very dark brown (such as specimen pictured here), through greyish-brown and olive green to yellow or even brick-red. Underside ranges from white to yellow, speckled with brown. The dark patches on the back vary, but there is always a dark patch, enclosing the eardrum, just behind the eye. The legs usually have dark transverse bands. There is a prominent skin fold on each side of the body. Eats slugs, worms, snails, and many other invertebrates on land, but doesn't feed in the water. Spends most of its time in damp places on land and moves to ponds and ditches to breed in Spring. Their gelatinous egg masses (frogspawn) give rise to tadpoles that turn into little frogs in about three months. Winter is passed in a dormant state, often in mud at the bottom of ponds.tones are bright yellow butterflies, and are often the first butterflies to be seen in spring. Male brimstone butterflies have sulphur-yellow forewings and hindwings with an orange central spot. The female's fore- and hindwings are a delicate yellow or pale green with an orange central spot. Both butterflies have greenish veined underwings. The pupa looks like a curled leaf. New adults emerge from their chrysalids in July and live until the following July. Adults hibernate over winter in woodlands and emerge on warm spring days. Last year's brimstones are often the first butterflies to be seen in spring. They are most likely to be found in woodland, gardens or meadows, sipping nectar from teasel, knapweed and buddleia. Brimstones are common in most of the UK, and have been spreading in recent years, particularly in northern England."
Caterpillars,Brown-tail Moth,Europroctis chrysorrhoea,"Euproctis chrysorrhoea, a plain white species when at rest, although the abdomen, as the name suggests, has a brown tuft of hairs which the female uses to cover the eggs with when they are laid. The species is distributed mainly around the south and east coasts of England, and in some years can become locally abundant. The caterpillars are well-known for their urticating hairs; they cause extreme irritation if in contact with human skin. They feed in a communal web on the leaves of Hawthorn (Crataegus) and Blackthorn (Prunus spinosa)."
Caterpillars,Cinnabar Moth,Tyria jacobaeae,"The cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) is a brightly coloured arctiid moth, named after the red mineral cinnabar because of the red patches on its predominantly black wings. Cinnabar moths are about 20mm long and have a wingspan of 32 to 42 mm. Cinnabar moths are day-flying insects. Like many other brightly coloured moths, it is unpalatable; the larvae use members of the genus Senecio as foodplants. Many members of the genus have been recorded as foodplants, but for long-term population success, the presence of the larger species such as ragwort is needed. Smaller plant species, such as groundsel, are sometimes used, but since the species lays its eggs in large batches, survival tends to be reduced. The bright colours of both the larvae and the moths act as warning signs, so they are seldom eaten by predators."
Caterpillars,Mullein Moth,Cucullia verbasci,"Distributed widely in England, most commonly in the south, and scarcer in Wales, this species is more often found in the caterpillar stage than adults, which however do come to light. The normal flight period is April to May, and the species occupies a range of open habitats as well as gardens. The larval foodplants in the wild are various species of mullein (Verbascum), but it also feeds in gardens on Buddleia."
Caterpillars,Small Tortoiseshell,Aglais urticae,"The Small Tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae) is a small and attractive butterfly often seen in gardens, especially feeding on buddleia. Wingspan is about 50mm. The wings are orange with a thin border of brown with small blue dots along the sides. At the front edge of the upper wings there is a pattern of black and yellow or orange marks. Eggs are usually laid on the common stinging nettle, and the caterpillars are yellow with dense black speckling and two yellow lines down their back and one along each side. They have black spines along their sides and back. They feed on nettle leaves, often spinning leaves together. The adults drink nectar from flowers such as thistles and buddleia. The adults will very often rest with their wings closed but will open and close them rapidly, flashing their bright colours to confuse and alarm predators. Small Tortoiseshells are not listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List 2000."
Damselflies,Azure Damselfly,Coenagrion puella,"Adult male Azure damselflies have a head and thorax patterned with blue and black. They have an azure blue abdomen patterned with black markings. Adult female Azure Damselflies have a head and thorax pattern similar to that of the male, but with dull green replacing the blue colour. The abdominal segments are largely black in colour, with narrow pale markings at the junction between each segment. Mature adults are seen frequently mating and laying eggs. It usually stays close to the vegetation around the pond or lake and flies from May to September. This common Damselfly looks very like a Common Blue Damselfly, but a close look can distinguish between the two. The behaviour is also different - unlike Common Blues, they rarely fly out over large stretches of water. They are not normally as common around August and September, June and July being the peak of their populations."
Damselflies,Banded Demoiselle,Calopteryx splendens,"The male Banded demoiselle has a brilliant metallic blue body. Wings are less abruptly narrowed than other damselflies and also differ from them in being coloured. Females have greenish-yellow tinged wings, but the male has a dark blueish-black area of colouration on both fore and hind wings. Males are usually territorial, but large numbers can sometimes be found in lush bankside plants and on floating objects. They court females by opening their wings and performing an aerial dance. They are usually found among mature, slow-flowing streams and rivers and sometimes canals. The females lay eggs on a wide variety of emergent or floating plants, sometimes even submerging to do so. The eggs hatch after 14 days, the emerging larvae having very long legs and appearing very stick-shaped. They overwinter buried in mud; when they are ready to moult into an adult, they climb up a suitable reed or plant and shed their skin."
Damselflies,Blue-tailed Damselfly,Ischnura elegans,"Best distinguished from the similar Common Blue Damselfly by the thinner blue stripes on its thorax. The female is much darker with mainly black markings on its abdomen interspersed with greenish rings. Abdomen usually black with 8th segment bright blue in both sexes, but female sometimes lacks blue. Pterostigma bicoloured. Catches prey in flight or on leaves of foliage or even from spiders webs. Found around still waters of all kinds, including polluted ponds, and are widespread and common throughout most of the UK."
Damselflies,Common Blue Damselfly,Enallagma cyathigerum,"The Common Blue Damselfly can be easily mistaken for the Azure Damselfly (Coenagrion puella), but on the back and the thorax, the Common Blue Damselfly has more blue than black; for the Azure Damselfly it is the other way around. The second segment of the thorax has a distinctive spot with a line below connecting to the third segment. Another difference can be observed when inspecting the side of the thorax. The Common Blue Damselfly has only one small black stripe there, while all other blue damselflies have two. This small, brightly coloured damselfly is probably the most common of dragonflies and damselflies throughout much of Britain. It inhabits a wide range of habitats, from small ponds to rivers. They are especially common at lakes and reservoirs."
Damselflies,Emerald Damselfly,Lestes sponsa,"One of the larger damselflies, this species is most common in July and August. It is often found by ponds and lakes, and is very rarely seen along flowing water. Emerald Damselflies like to perch among reeds, their colour providing good camouflage. They are not as strong fliers when compared to other common damselflies such as the common blue or large red damselflies, but they are more likely to be seen on misty, rainy days then those species. When disturbed they usually do not fly very far away, landing on another perch a few yards away. Their habit of perching with their wings half open is characteristic of the family Lestidae and gives rise to their other common name of spreadwings. A population can consist of several hundred insects."
Damselflies,Large Red Damselfly,Pyrrhosoma nymphula,"Often the earliest dragonfly or damselfly to appear, it is relatively easy to identify being red and black, with the black legs, which distinguish it from the Small Red Damselfly. Measuring roughly 36mm in length, the Large Red Damselfly is a large, active, deep red damselfly with black legs and a bronze-black top to the thorax which has broad red or yellow stripes. The female exists in several colour forms varying in the amount of red and black on the abdomen from nearly all black in f. melanotum to mainly red in f. fulvipes. The pterostigma is black. This is one of the earliest species to appear each spring and can be found in almost any freshwater habitat but rarely on fast-flowing rivers or streams. Widespread and common in Britain and Ireland."
Earwigs,Common Earwig,Forficula auricularia,"Length 10-15mm, excluding the pincers. The latter are 4-9mm in the male, strongly curved and with a flat base. Female pincers are 4-5mm and almost straight. The body is shiny brown, with the hindwings projecting as short triangles from under the short forewings. Mainly vegetarian, eating a wide range of living and dead plant material, but also taking some insect food. Largely nocturnal, hiding under loose bark and in other crevices by day. Young earwigs always have straight, slender pincers. The white or cream earwigs that are often unearthed in the garden are not different species; simply individuals that have just changed their skins. Adult all year, but usually dormant in winter. Abundant almost everywhere, in the house as well as in the garden. Often in trees, commonly nestling in clusters of apples in late summer. Throughout Europe and the only earwig commonly seen in the UK."
Froghoppers,Common Froghopper,Philaenus spumarius,"A spectacularly variable species, with many dramatically different colour forms. Usually they are yellowish, brownish or black, with brighter patches on a dark background, but also with dark markings on a lighter background. An extremely common species in a wide range of plants across the UK, the larvae are the familiar producers of 'cuckoo-spit' in gardens. Their larvae in the foam nests are largely protected from predators and also get the necessary moisture for the development and temperature, so their mortality remains low even in bad weather. The larval stage lasts about 50 days. The adults leave the foam nest only when it is completely dried. This takes about ten days. The females mate soon after. Adults can be seen June to September, length 5-7 mm."
Froghoppers,Red and Black Froghopper,Cercopis vulnerata,"With a length of 9-11mm, Cercopis vulnerata is a truly unmistakable species; it is very commonly found resting on the stems of grasses and other low-growing plants and is one of our largest homopterans. The nymphs are rarely seen, as they feed on underground roots. Adults are found in mainland Britain south of the Scottish Highlands, in a variety of wooded and open habitats. Adults can be seen April to August."
Froghoppers,,Neophilaenus lineatus,"Neophilaenus can be separated from Philaenus by the straight costal margin in the basal two-thirds of the forewing; there are several UK species. With a length of 5-7mm, Neophilaenus lineatus is identified by the pale line running down the outside edge of the forewing, and by the central, anterior 'plate' on the vertex which is wider than long (the latter feature separating it from the similar, but rare N. longiceps, which is restricted to salt-marshes). The apex of the scutellum is normally dark, and the face has dark transverse lines, and a dark midline. There is a dark form that occurs in certain populations living on purple moor grass Molinia caerulea. A very common grassland species across the UK. Adults are active June to November, sometimes overwintering."
Froghoppers,Green Leaf-hopper,Cicadella viridis,"With a length of 6-8mm, Cicadella viridis is a largish, attractive species which is widespread and common in damp grassy and marshy areas throughout the UK, although they can be encountered in drier areas too. The bicoloured pronotum (yellow at the front and green at the rear) is distinctive. The female's forewings are bright turqoise green, but the male's can be much darker blue-purple and may even appear blackish. The front of the head is pale yellow, with two black spots near the compound eyes. Adults are active July-October. The larvae are yellowish and have two brownish stripes running from head to the end of the abdomen. Cicadella viridis may have one or more generations per year. This species overwinters in the egg stage."
Grasshoppers,Common Field Grasshopper,Chorthippus brunneus,"Chorthippus brunneus, the common field grasshopper, is found throughout the UK, commonly in mostly dry and often sparse grassland, but also in gardens, from the beginning of summer until October. Length 15-25 mm, with a brownish colour, but the colour varies, striped and mottled forms occur with parts of the body varying from buff through orange to purple.Very hairy below the thorax in both sexes. Diet is herbivorous, feeding mainly on grasses. Eggs are laid into the soil. Long season with nymphs hatching from late March. Adults appear from June and may survive until early December. A gregarious species, males can be seen displaying to females by rubbing their legs against their wings to create a 'song' - in this case, it is brief, single chirrup, repeated at short intervals."
Grasshoppers,Meadow Grasshopper,Chorthippus parallelus,"Chorthippus parallelus is typically predominantly green. There is often a dark grey/brown stripe running through the eye and the flanks of the abdomen are usually more or less mottled black or with distinct black bars. The hind femur is typically plain pale brown or greenish above with a herringbone pattern extending down the middle. Like the Field Grasshopper, some rather bizarre colour variations occur in this species; purple specimens are not that uncommon. At maturity, the females wings barely extend halfway down the abdomen. Mature males have longer wings that almost extend to the tip of the abdomen which, at maturity, is brownish. Its life cycle is very similar to that of the Field Grasshopper although the emergence of the nymphs and adult maturity occur slightly earlier. Very common and found in all but the driest grassland sites. Nymphs from late April to June, adults from June until mid November."
Harvestmen,,Lacinius ephippiatus,"The harvestmen most frequently seen are species of Opilio, Odiellus and Leiobunum that live in hedgerows, parks and gardens amongst rough vegetation or on tree trunks, walls and fences. All are moderately large, the body up to about 10 mm long, and more or less brownish in colour. Most species are nocturnal, though often seen resting on walls and fences by day, with legs spread widely and almost invisible. Harvestmen feed on a wide range of living and dead animal matter, mainly comprised of small invertebrates (insect larvae, mites, young spiders, etc., or their dead remains), although they sometimes also attack juicy plant matter, primarily for its water content. More often, though, they obtain water from dewdrops on vegetation. Most species have an annual life cycle, usually passing the winter as eggs and maturing in late summer - hence their common name."
Harvestmen,,Leiobunum rotundum,"The harvestmen most frequently seen are species of Opilio, Odiellus and Leiobunum that live in hedgerows, parks and gardens amongst rough vegetation or on tree trunks, walls and fences. All are moderately large, the body up to about 10 mm long, and more or less brownish in colour.

Mammals,Common Seal,Phoca vitulina,"The smaller of our two seal species, Common Seals (also known as Harbour Seals) are more commonly found around sheltered shores and estuaries, where they haul out on sandbanks and beaches. When out of the water, they sometimes hold their body in a curved 'banana' position, with their head and tail both in the air at the same time. Like Grey Seals, they feed on fish, but also eat squids, whelks, crabs and mussels. The young are born during the summer. Can be distinguished from the Grey Seal by its smaller size and shorter head with a blunter, more dog-like profile. Very variable in colour, from blonde to black, but generally grey with dark spots. Found around the coasts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and eastern England."
Mammals,Fallow Deer,Dama dama,"Fallow deer are the most widespread deer in the UK and can be seen in numerous parks and forests. They are smaller than red deer but bigger than roe deer; however, if their size doesn't give their identity away, their long tail with a black stripe and palmate antlers should be the clinching factors. Fallow deer are sociable creatures, and for most of the year can be seen in two distinct unisex groups. The female (doe) gives birth in June and July and her young remain with her until the following year when the males (bucks), at about 18 months old, are pushed out and join the elder bucks. In spring the bucks start the annual cycle of shedding and regrowing their antlers. The antlers take 4-6 weeks to grow back, depending on the size and age of the animal, but they will be soft until about mid-August, leaving them vulnerable during this period. With their antlers formed and their confidence back, the rutting season will begin."
Mammals,Grey Seal,Halichoerus grypus,"Grey seals have grey and brown fur, sometimes with a pattern of blotches; no ears visible; long muzzle; nostrils parallel; larger and darker than common seal, with flat or convex profile to its head (the common seal has a concave profile). Grey seals around Great Britain are found mainly along exposed rocky northern and western coasts. They also occur in the south west and off the east coast, around the Isle of May and the Farne Islands off Northumberland. Between the tides they haul themselves out on to rocks, usually on uninhabited offshore islands; though some haul-outs are on secluded mainland beaches. Grey seals are gregarious at these haul-outs, sometimes forming large groups of several hundred animals, especially when they are moulting their fur in the spring. They are not, however, very sociable and keep a distance between one another. About two-thirds of greys seals' time is spent at sea where they hunt and feed. In the autumn grey seals congregate at traditional sites on land to breed. The timing of births varies around the coast, beginning in September in West Wales, in October in western Scotland, and as late as November in the Farne Islands. Sand eels and cod are their most important foods, but grey seals are opportunistic feeders and probably take whatever fish are most abundant."
Mammals,Grey Squirrel,Sciurus carolinensis,"Head and body 25-30cm; tail up to 25cm. Back and tail always grey, although flanks sometimes may have a reddish tinge. White undersides. Eats nuts, especially acorns and hazel nuts; other fruits, buds and young twigs; strips bark to eat nutritious tissue below; also eats insects, birds eggs and nestlings, and regularly 'steals' from bird tables and bird feeders. A serious forest pest, also damaging garden and orchard trees. Diurnal, keeping mainly to the trees. Neatly split hazel nut shells and roughly chewed cones litter feeding sites. Mixed woodland, orchards, parks and gardens. A North American animal, introduced to the British Isles late in the 19th century and now common all over England and Wales, where it has largely replaced the native Red Squirrel; less common in Scotland and Ireland."
Millipedes,Striped Millipede,Omnatoiulus sabulosus,"The Striped Millipede, Ommatoiulus sabulosus, is a plump, cylindrical brown millipede that is easily identified by the pair of ginger stripes along its back. It is one of the largest British millipedes. It prefers sandy soils and is often found in the daytime, unlike most other millipedes. It is sometimes found under logs but it also likes to climb and can be seen up walls and in trees, where it also grazes on algae. Present all year round. Like other millipedes it eats dead and decaying vegetation. This species is common and widespread in the UK."
Slugs,Large Black Slug,Arion ater,"Up to about 20cm in length when fully extended, but more usually 10-15cm. Colour ranges from jet black, through chestnut and orange to pale grey and creamy white. Brown and cream forms always have an orange fringe to the sole (see photograph above). There is no keel on the back, but the body is covered with elongated tubercles. When disturbed, the slug contracts into a small hemispherical position and often sways from side to side. Its mucus is extremely sticky. An omnivorous species, eating carrion and dung as well as vegetable matter. It prefers rotting vegetation to living plants and consequently rarely does much harm in the garden. Largely nocturnal, but large numbers have been seen on freshly mown roadside verges feeding on the grass after daytime rain. Clusters of their pearly-white spherical eggs, about 5mm in diameter, are often dug up in the garden and compost heaps. Common throughout the UK."
Slugs,Yellow Slug,Limax flavus,"This is a large yellowish slug which can grow up to 10 cm in length. The body is marbled and mottled in an olive-yellow colour. Its tentacles are blue. It has a central yellow line along the keel which extends from the tail to around half the body length, though may be broken into dashes. It is common and widespread in England, Wales and Ireland. It is mostly associated with houses and gardens - being known to venture indoors especially cellars after dark. Feeds mostly on fungi, decaying matter and vegetables, especially on compost heaps, but also feeds voraciously on seedlings and vegetables so where it does occur on agriculture and horticulture land it can do serious damage."
Woodlice,Common Rough Woodlouse,Porcellio scaber,"Up to 17mm in length, this is probably the commonest species of woodlouse found in the UK, sometimes even showing up in houses. Found throughout the UK, it loves damp, shaded places - lift any large stone, log, or even a pot from your patio and you'll find them, usually feeding on dead plant matter. It is usually grey in colour, but can be mottled with yellow or brown. When viewed under a hand lens you'll see where the ""rough"" name comes from. The upper surface is covered in bumps. If you turn the creature over you'll notice it has two pairs of lungs, which appear as white patches near the tail end. The end of the antennae (the Flagellum) is in two segments. The eyes are composed of a group of shiny black bumps (called 'ocelli')."
Woodlice,Common Shiny Woodlouse,Oniscus asellus,"Oniscus asellus, or the Common Shiny Woodlouse, is one of the largest and most common species of woodlouse in the British Isles and Western and Northern Europe, growing to lengths of 16 mm and widths of 6 mm. They are generally flatter than other large woodlice, and their bodies are usually brownish-black in colour, with paler mottling and very pale edges to their segmental plates. Their carapace is usually rather shiny, while the underside is pale. The species can also be identified by its long pointed telson. Oniscus asellus has a strong exoskeleton and seven pairs of legs, but are born with six pairs. They have antennae that reach about half of their body length, which they use to feel around in their dark environment. The species is particularly fond of rotting wood and are one of the commonest species found under garden logs and stones in their range. They eat vegetables, various types of detritus such as dead plant and animal matter, including rotting wood."
